# WACOM DUAL-MONITOR SETUP
This script maps your wacom tablet to one of your
currently connected displays and recalculates tablet's area such
that it corresponds to your display's aspect ratio.
## Example
You have 2 displays connected one of which is 1280 x 1024 (4:3). Your tablet is 16:9.
After remapping vertical area will stay unchanged while horizontal will be cut from the right.
